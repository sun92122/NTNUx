Level2:踩水保持頭部在水面上超過90秒、仰漂90秒。將於第一周上課將進行上述自救救生能力測驗，合格者才准予修課，未參加測驗者，不能修課。海上活動受潮汐風浪流等因素進行風險管理考量，九月中以後受東北季風影響較大，因此戶外課程預計在九月14~16日完成，請預修課的同學事先做好時間安排。","counter":"0","counter_exceptAuth":"0","course_avg":"","course_code":"CEU0483","course_group":"","course_kind":"半","credit":"2.0","deleteQ":"","dept_chiabbr":"公領系（學）","dept_code":"EU07","dept_engfull":"","dept_group":"","dept_group_name":"","emi":"","eng_name":"Outdoor
